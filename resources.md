## Few more imp. suggestions
1. Everyone should have professional [**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/) profile for future job purpose build nice LinkedIn profile.
2. If you are a programmer you should have [**GitHub**](github.com) profile with your learnings and projects.
3. At the end of the day it is not only about learning but we have to apply the things which we have learned. so try to explore more on the concept and also share your knowledge to the community by writing a blog of what you have learned on day to day basis or on entire training program [**@Medium**](https://medium.com/), or [**@dev.to**](https://dev.to/new), or write an article [**@LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/post/new/).
